**Running multiple salon locations is complex.** You don't just need salon software - you need enterprise-level systems that scale, centralize, and analyze.

This comparison helps you choose the perfect multi-location software. We tested 12 systems and selected the top 5.

## Why Standard Software Doesn't Work

What works for 1 location fails at 3+ locations:

### Problems With Single-Location Software

**1. No Central Overview**
- Login per location (time waster)
- No cross-location reporting
- Difficult to compare performance

**2. Duplicate Customers**
- Customer books at location A and B
- Two different profiles
- No complete treatment history

**3. Inventory Chaos**
- Each location manages its own inventory
- No transfers between locations
- Over-ordering at one, shortages at another

**4. Inconsistent Service**
- Different prices per location
- Different appointment procedures
- Brand dilution

**5. Staff Inefficiency**
- Employees work at multiple locations
- Separate scheduling per location
- No overview of where they are
