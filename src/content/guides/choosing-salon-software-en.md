## Common Mistakes When Choosing

Our research shows these are the 3 biggest mistakes salon owners make:

### 1. Focusing Only on Price (43% of salons)

**The mistake:** Choosing "free" software without calculating hidden costs.

**The reality:** With 100 online bookings per month, you pay €1,050 per month at 35% commission. A €39/month system is then 96% cheaper.

**Do this:** Calculate your total costs including commissions, transaction fees, and addons.

### 2. Too Many Features (31% of salons)

**The mistake:** Choosing a complex system "for later" but not using it now.

**The reality:** Your team gets frustrated, training takes weeks, and you never use 80% of the features.

**Do this:** Start with basic features and upgrade when you really need them.

### 3. Not Using Trial Period (67% of salons)

**The mistake:** Signing up directly without testing the system with your team.

**The reality:** After 2 months, you discover it doesn't work as you thought.

**Do this:** Test at least 2-3 systems during the full trial period with your entire team.
