It's Tuesday morning. Your first client is at the front desk, phone in hand, ready to pay. "Can I tap to pay?" Of course. But then the next client asks if she can pay via Tikkie. And the one after that wants to split — half cash, half card. Meanwhile, your old register is beeping, printing illegible receipts, and you have no idea what your actual revenue is today.

Sound familiar? You're not alone. Many salon owners are still running a POS system that worked fine five years ago but no longer meets what clients expect in 2026. In this article, we compare the most important POS systems for salons on the Dutch market and help you make the right choice.

## How the Netherlands Pays in 2026

The way Dutch consumers pay is changing fast. Cash is declining steadily, and digital payment methods are taking over. Here are the numbers that matter:

| Payment Trend | Figure |
|---|---|
| Share of digital payments in the Netherlands | 84% of all transactions |
| Share of cash payments | 16% (declining ~3% per year) |
| iDEAL transactions per year | 1.3 billion+ |
| Contactless payment adoption | 91% of all card transactions |
| Average salon transaction value | €47 — €85 |
| Tikkie users in the Netherlands | 9.5 million+ |
| QR code payment growth (year-over-year) | +28% |

The numbers are clear: your POS system needs to keep up with how your clients want to pay. A system that only supports card and cash is leaving opportunities on the table.

## What to Look for in a Salon POS System

Not every POS system is built for salons. You need specific features that match how a salon operates. These are the most important criteria:

**Payment Methods**
Clients expect choice. Card, contactless, QR codes, iDEAL for online deposits, and Tikkie for quick partial payments. A good POS system supports all of them without extra hardware.

**Real-Time Revenue Reporting**
No more endless spreadsheets at the end of the day. You want to see your revenue at any moment — by staff member, by service, by product.

**Product Sales Tracking**
Many salons sell products alongside services. Your POS should track which products are selling, current stock levels, and profit margins.

**Integration with Your Booking System**
If your POS is separate from your calendar, you're entering everything twice. An integrated system saves time and prevents errors.

**Split Payments**
Clients who want to split — between two people, or half card half cash — shouldn't cause headaches.

**Tip Functionality**
Digital tipping is becoming increasingly popular. Your POS system should make it easy for clients to add a tip when paying by card.

**Receipt Options**
Paper receipt, digital receipt via email or QR code. Flexibility matters, especially as more clients prefer to skip the paper receipt.

## Comparison: POS Features by Salon Software

Below we compare four popular POS systems for salons in the Netherlands. We focus specifically on the features that matter for your salon.

| Feature | Salonized | Treatwell | Planty | SalonUp |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| iDEAL integration | ✅ | ⚠️ Limited | ❌ | ✅ |
| Contactless payments | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Tikkie support | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Split payments | ⚠️ Manual | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Product sales tracking | ✅ | ⚠️ Basic | ✅ | ✅ |
| Real-time revenue dashboard | ✅ | ⚠️ Delayed | ✅ | ✅ |
| Staff commission tracking | ❌ | ❌ | ⚠️ Basic | ✅ |
| Automated VAT reporting | ⚠️ Export required | ❌ | ⚠️ Export required | ✅ |
| Tip on card payment | ✅ | ⚠️ Limited | ❌ | ✅ |
| Digital receipt (email/QR) | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |

*Comparison based on publicly available information and user experiences, February 2026. Features may vary by subscription tier.*

**Salonized** offers a solid POS system with good basic integrations. However, it lacks some Dutch-specific payment options like Tikkie and has limited commission tracking.

**Treatwell** focuses more on its marketplace model. POS features are present but less comprehensive, and reporting can sometimes lag behind.

**Planty** is a newer player with strong product tracking and dashboards. Dutch-specific payment options are still being developed.

**SalonUp** scores strongly on Netherlands-specific features: Tikkie integration, automated VAT reporting, and full split payment support. The combination of booking system and POS in one platform eliminates double data entry.

## ROI: What Does an Integrated POS System Deliver?

Let's be honest — a new POS system costs money. But what does it return?

| Factor | Old System | Integrated POS |
|---|---|---|
| Time spent on administration per week | 4-6 hours | 1-2 hours |
| Errors in revenue registration | 5-8% deviation | < 1% deviation |
| Missed product sales (untracked) | ~€200-400/month | Fully registered |
| Time for VAT filing per quarter | 3-5 hours | 30 min (automated) |
| Clients dropping off due to limited payment options | ~3-5% | < 1% |

*Estimates based on averages from salons with 2-5 staff members in the Netherlands.*

Do the math: if you save 4 hours per week on administration, at an hourly rate of €40 that's already **€640 per month**. Add the missed product sales and clients dropping off, and a modern POS system pays for itself within two to three months.

## Checklist: Choosing and Implementing Your Salon POS

Use this checklist to make the right choice:

- [ ] **Assess your payment needs** — Which payment methods do your clients ask for? Card, contactless, Tikkie, iDEAL?
- [ ] **Check integration with your current booking system** — Or choose an all-in-one solution
- [ ] **Test the reporting** — Request a demo and verify you get real-time insight into revenue per staff member and per service
- [ ] **Verify VAT reporting** — Can the system automatically calculate and export your VAT?
- [ ] **Ask about split payments and tipping** — Essential for salons, often overlooked when choosing
- [ ] **Review hardware requirements** — Do you need a separate terminal, or does it work on your existing tablet or phone?
- [ ] **Plan a transition period** — Run parallel with your old system for at least two weeks
- [ ] **Train your team** — Make sure every staff member is comfortable with the new system before going live
- [ ] **Set up digital receipts** — Better for the environment and appreciated by clients
- [ ] **Evaluate after 30 days** — Measure whether the time savings and revenue improvements match your expectations

## The Future of Payments in the Salon

The trend is clear: clients want to pay flexibly and quickly. QR payments are growing, contactless is the norm, and cash is slowly disappearing. A POS system that is already prepared for these changes gives your salon a competitive edge.

Investing in a modern POS system isn't just a cost — it's a step toward a more professional, efficient salon that clients love coming back to.
