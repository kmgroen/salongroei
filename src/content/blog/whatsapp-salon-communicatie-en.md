## Your clients don't read SMS anymore — but they do open WhatsApp

It's Monday morning. You diligently sent SMS reminders on Friday for today's appointments. Yet at 10:00 there are two empty chairs in your salon. The clients? They simply never saw the text. One thought it was spam, the other has SMS notifications turned off entirely.

Sound familiar? You're not alone. While salons across the Netherlands still rely on email and SMS, there's one channel that virtually every client actually opens: **WhatsApp**. With a 98% open rate, it's the most direct line to your client — and yet most salons still aren't using it professionally.

In this article, you'll discover how WhatsApp can transform your salon communication, which software supports it best, and how to get started today.

## WhatsApp in the Netherlands: the numbers speak for themselves

The Netherlands has one of the highest WhatsApp adoption rates in the world. Nearly everyone with a smartphone uses it daily.

| Channel | Open rate | Average response time | Click-through rate | Reach in NL |
|---------|-----------|----------------------|--------------------|-------------|
| Email | 20% | 6 hours | 2.5% | 89% |
| SMS | 90% | 3 minutes | 8% | 95% |
| WhatsApp | 98% | 90 seconds | 18% | 98% |

The conclusion is clear: if you want your message to be read, WhatsApp gives you the highest chance of success. Not only are messages opened, clients also respond faster and click through more often to links — for example, to confirm an appointment or leave a review.

## 7 ways salons use WhatsApp

WhatsApp is more than just a chat app. For salons, it offers a complete communication platform:

### 1. Appointment confirmations
Immediately after booking, your client receives a confirmation via WhatsApp. No email disappearing into the promotions tab — just a message that's instantly visible.

### 2. 24-hour reminders
Sending a reminder the day before the appointment drastically reduces no-shows. With WhatsApp, you can be almost certain the message gets read.

### 3. Last-minute availability alerts
A client cancels? Send a message to your waiting list: "A slot has just opened up today at 2:00 PM for a cut & blow-dry. Interested?" Within minutes, you've filled the chair again.

### 4. Product recommendations
After a treatment, you can send personalised product advice: "Hi Lisa, the Olaplex treatment from last week works best with these home care products."

### 5. Birthday messages
A personal birthday message with a small gift — for example, 10% off the next appointment — significantly boosts client loyalty.

### 6. Before/after photo sharing
Clients love seeing their transformation. Send the photos via WhatsApp and ask if you can share them on social media.

### 7. Review requests
A friendly message after an appointment: "Thanks for visiting! Would you mind leaving a review?" Include a direct link to Google Reviews. The barrier is low and conversion is high.

## WhatsApp Business API vs. personal WhatsApp

Many salon owners send messages from their personal WhatsApp account. That works for five clients, but not for five hundred. The key differences:

- **Personal WhatsApp**: maximum 256 contacts in a broadcast, no automation, no calendar integration, risk of being blocked for bulk messaging
- **WhatsApp Business App**: free, business profile, labels and quick replies, but still manual
- **WhatsApp Business API**: full automation, integration with your salon software, template messages approved by Meta, unlimited reach, professional appearance

For serious salon communication, you need API integration — and that runs through your salon software.

## Which salon software supports WhatsApp?

Not all salon platforms offer the same WhatsApp capabilities. We compared the four most popular platforms:

| Feature | Salonized | Treatwell | Planty | SalonUp |
|---------|-----------|-----------|--------|---------|
| WhatsApp appointment reminders | ❌ (SMS only) | ❌ (SMS & email) | ⚠️ (via Zapier) | ✅ Native |
| Automated confirmations | ❌ | ❌ | ⚠️ | ✅ Native |
| Marketing messages | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Two-way chat | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Template messages | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Broadcast lists | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| WhatsApp booking button | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| WhatsApp module price | n/a | n/a | €15/mo add-on | Included |

*Data based on publicly available information and product pages, February 2026*

SalonUp is currently the only platform with a full, native WhatsApp Business API integration. Salonized offers SMS reminders only, Treatwell works via SMS and email, and Planty has a limited connection through external tools.

## The ROI of WhatsApp communication

Investing in WhatsApp communication delivers measurable results. Below are the average improvements salons report after implementation:

| Metric | Before WhatsApp | After WhatsApp | Improvement |
|--------|----------------|----------------|-------------|
| No-show rate | 12-18% | 3-5% | 70% reduction |
| Rebooking rate | 45% | 67% | +22 percentage points |
| Reviews per month | 2-4 | 12-18 | 4x more |
| Waitlist fill rate | 20% | 65% | +45 percentage points |
| Average client response time | 6+ hours | 12 minutes | 30x faster |

*Sources: SalonUp User Analytics 2025, WhatsApp Business Impact Report 2025*

For an average salon with 400 appointments per month, reducing no-shows from 15% to 4% means approximately **44 additional completed appointments per month**. At an average treatment price of €55, that's **€2,420 in additional revenue per month** — or nearly **€30,000 per year**.

## Implementation checklist

Ready to start using WhatsApp for your salon? Follow this step-by-step plan:

- [ ] **Choose salon software with native WhatsApp integration** — avoid manual workarounds
- [ ] **Apply for a WhatsApp Business API account** through your software provider
- [ ] **Set up template messages** for confirmations, reminders and follow-ups
- [ ] **Request client consent** (opt-in) — this is legally required under GDPR
- [ ] **Configure automatic triggers** — booking = confirmation, 24h before = reminder
- [ ] **Create broadcast segments** — e.g. "hasn't booked in 6+ weeks" or "birthday this month"
- [ ] **Track your results** — monitor no-shows, rebookings and reviews
- [ ] **Optimise after 30 days** — test different message timings and copy

## The future of salon communication is personal

WhatsApp isn't a trend — it's the new standard. Clients expect fast, personal communication through the channel they use most. Salons that act on this now are building an advantage that's hard to catch up to.

The combination of automation and personal touch makes WhatsApp unique: you can reach hundreds of clients with messages that feel as if they were written just for them.
