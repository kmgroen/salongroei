## Your work is stunning — but does anyone see it?

Picture this: you're a hairdresser or beauty specialist with years of experience. Every client leaves your salon glowing. But your Instagram account has 87 followers, your last post was three months ago, and your Google Business profile has two reviews from 2023.

Meanwhile, a competitor opens two streets away. Less experience, less quality — but 10,000 Instagram followers, daily Reels and a 4.9 Google rating. Guess who's attracting the new clients?

In 2026, social media is no longer a luxury for salons. It's your digital storefront, portfolio and acquisition channel rolled into one. In this guide, you'll learn exactly how to use Instagram, TikTok, Google Business and Facebook to attract more clients — and which software helps you do it.

## The numbers: why social media is essential

| Statistic | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Consumers using Instagram for beauty inspiration | 74% | Sprout Social, 2025 |
| Average engagement rate for beauty accounts on Instagram | 1.87% | Rival IQ Beauty Report, 2025 |
| Increase in bookings after active Google Business profile | +38% | BrightLocal, 2025 |
| TikTok users who made a purchase after beauty content | 67% | TikTok Business Insights, 2025 |
| Consumers who read online reviews for local services | 92% | BrightLocal Consumer Survey, 2025 |
| Salons with active social media reporting revenue growth | 61% | Phorest Salon Owners Summit, 2025 |

The conclusion is clear: salons that invest in online visibility grow faster.

## Platform strategies per channel

### Instagram: your visual portfolio

Instagram remains the most important platform for salons. Focus on:

- **Before/after Reels** — The most shared content type in the beauty industry. Film the starting point, the process and the end result in 15-30 seconds.
- **Stories for daily interaction** — Polls, question stickers and behind-the-scenes keep your audience engaged.
- **Booking link in bio** — Use a direct booking link so inspired followers can book an appointment immediately.
- **Highlights per service** — Organise your best work by category: cuts, colour, bridal, skincare.

### TikTok: viral reach for salons

TikTok offers unprecedented organic reach. Salons that are active here reach potential clients far beyond their immediate area.

- **Transformation videos** — The "wow factor" of a complete makeover performs best.
- **Trending sounds** — Use popular audio to boost your reach. Check the trending page daily.
- **Behind-the-scenes** — Show how a colour treatment is mixed or what your salon looks like before opening time.
- **Educational content** — Tips for hair care or skincare position you as an expert.

### Google Business Profile: local discoverability

For local clients, Google Business is your most important channel. An optimised profile appears in the local 3-pack for searches like "hairdresser near me".

- **Actively collect reviews** — Ask every satisfied client for a review. Send a link via WhatsApp or email after their visit.
- **Upload photos** — Salons with more than 100 photos receive 520% more calls than salons without photos.
- **Set up a booking button** — Link your online calendar directly to your Google profile.
- **Maintain Q&A** — Proactively answer frequently asked questions.

### Facebook: community and targeted ads

Facebook is not dead for salons. The platform works excellently for:

- **Local community groups** — Share your expertise in neighbourhood groups.
- **Events** — Promote open days, workshops or seasonal promotions.
- **Targeted ads** — Target women (or men) in your area, age group and with beauty interests. Effective from as little as 5 euros per day.

## Content that works: 6 proven formats

1. **Before/after transformations** — Always popular, always shareable.
2. **Time-lapse videos** — An entire treatment in 30 seconds.
3. **Client testimonials** — Let satisfied clients share their experience on camera.
4. **Product tips** — Which shampoo for which hair type? You're the expert.
5. **Team introductions** — Introduce your stylists. People book with people, not with a business name.
6. **Behind-the-scenes** — The chaos before opening time, tidying up after a busy day. Authenticity scores.

## Online reviews: your most powerful marketing

92% of consumers read online reviews before choosing a local service provider. For salons, reviews are directly linked to new bookings.

**How do you ask for reviews?**
- Send a friendly message within 2 hours of the visit with a direct link to your Google page.
- Make it easy: the fewer clicks, the more reviews.
- Use automated review requests through your salon software.

**How do you respond to negative reviews?**
- Always respond within 24 hours.
- Thank the reviewer, acknowledge the issue and offer a solution.
- Never get defensive or personal. Future clients will read your response.

## Software comparison: marketing features

Not all salon software offers the same marketing integrations. Here's which tools help you with your online visibility:

| Feature | Salonized | Treatwell | Planty | SalonUp |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Social media booking integration | ✅ | ⚠️ Only via Treatwell link | ❌ | ✅ |
| Automated review requests | ✅ | ⚠️ Limited | ❌ | ✅ |
| Google Business sync | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Instagram booking widget | ⚠️ Via external tool | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Email marketing campaigns | ✅ | ❌ | ⚠️ Basic templates | ✅ |
| Referral programme | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Analytics dashboard | ⚠️ Basic statistics | ✅ | ⚠️ Limited | ✅ |

SalonUp offers the most complete set of marketing integrations, particularly the combination of Instagram booking widget, Google Business sync and a built-in referral programme. Salonized also scores well on review automation and email marketing. Treatwell is strong in discoverability via their own platform but limited in proprietary marketing tools.
